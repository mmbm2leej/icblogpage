      "What is random?\
      \n\
      Random is akin to chaos. Give me a 10 numbers from your head. Chances are that these numbers are a\
      good enough distance away from each other for you to judge sufficient enough to be considered\
      'random.' Well that's just it, because of that judgment, which is a normal thing... It's NOT random!\
      In a truly random series, the chance of getting the same number every time would be just as likely\
      as getting the numbers you thought of in the same sequence. Random is tricky, and it is just as tricky\
      for computers to spit out randomly as it would be for a person. Alot of thought has to go into\
      making a very 'good' random number generator. It can't be stressed enough especially for applications\
      like DNA sequencing, encryption, finance, the list goes on.\
      \n\n\
      Perfect random is impossible to attain\n\
      If you've done some coding, you might know about random() % n. Where n is the upper limit of the range\
      of numbers you're picking from. If you've done even more coding, you would know that this method is\
      the WORST thing you can do if HOW RANDOM is important. Every time the application is run with this,\
      the same series of numbers would be pulled in the same order. This is where seeding based on time of\
      execution helps.\
      \n\n\
      All computers follow a procedure.\n\
      If a pattern is found to something, it is no longer random.\
      This applies to even random(), from Java, JS, C++, and Python.\
      \n\n\
      Best thing out there\n\
      The best thing I've seen and worked with so far is the Mersenne Twister. Although I've heard of\
      SFMT which is a more efficient version of the same system, smaller and almost twice as fast. \
      \n\n\
      Quantum Computing\n\
      A colleague of mine brought up the capabilities of quantum computing and how this struggle of making\
      reliable RNGs would be a thing of the past. I've always had a problem with these. People who\
      study and practice Computer Science are computer scientists. \
      When a computer does something that isn't clear, you can ask a computer scientist why, and how.\
      Computer Science is about KNOWING why electronics behave as they do.\
      Quantum computing might bring with it a black box. 0s and 1s make sense to me, things that aren't\
      always 0s or 1s don't.\
      \n\n\
      Maybe it won't be that unclear once it's all fleshed out, and I'm worrying for nothing."

    title: "Meaning",
    pic: bojackpic,
    contents:
      "A friend of mine referenced a video, a philosophical critique of the show 'BoJack Horseman'.\
The show was about a fictional horse-human hybrid character struggling with existential dread.\n\n\
What was the point of anything that he did? Every crime he committed, every person he connected with.\
Everything he worked for and accomplished was all being questioned over the course of the show according to this\
video. My friend and I talked about it, nihilism, existentialism, just the general idea of meaning.\n\n\
We talked about how difficult it is for individuals to find their meaning, their purpose, their drive.\
I mentioned that it's something you can't really help someone with directly, in the sense that someone is\
struggling to define what they want to do, what they need to do, why they should, is the choice they are making\
the right one? You can't just tell them 'Just follow these 3 easy steps and you will be out of your rut!'\n\n\
Something like that, even when the intention is good, can lead to very damaging results. It's tough.\
At the end of the day, and when struggling people wake up the next morning... What will keep them going?\
The answer is something one needs to find for themselves, and although it can be frustrating how long it\
means to spend having no clue where to look, patience is all anyone can say is the thing to do about it.\n\n\
Being restless doesn't make that spark happen any sooner."
